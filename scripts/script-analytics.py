"""script-analytics.py — quantitative evidence on the script-author /
script-reviewer lane, extracted from local Claude Code JSONL transcripts.

Turns "that script took a lot of rounds and a long time before it was
useful" from an anecdote into numbers: rework rounds and their causes
(review findings, lint failures, usage/selftest failures), turns, tokens,
USD, and wall time to acceptance, per script and per agent type — so
"does a process tweak add time without adding quality" has evidence
behind it, not one memorable incident.

Read-only: it only reads local JSONL transcript files under
--projects-dir (default ~/.claude/projects) and appends to a local events
file the caller names. It never prints message, prompt, or tool
content — only derived counts, paths, timestamps, and ids.

Transcript layout this script expects (Claude Code CLI, verified live
2026-09-10 against 2.1.267):
    <projects-dir>/<slug>/<session-id>.jsonl
        the main-thread session transcript.
    <projects-dir>/<slug>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl
        one file per Agent-tool subagent launched from that session.
    <projects-dir>/<slug>/<session-id>/subagents/agent-<id>.meta.json
        {"agentType": "...", "description": "...", "toolUseId": "toolu_...",
         "spawnDepth": 1, "model": "..."}. toolUseId matches the id of the
        {"type":"tool_use","name":"Agent",...} block in the PARENT
        session's transcript that spawned this subagent; that block's
        "input" carries subagent_type, description, prompt (script paths
        and ticket live in the prompt), and model.

Numeric helpers, not reimplemented independently: this script loads
scripts/claude-cost.py and scripts/claude-cost-scan.py at runtime via
importlib.util.spec_from_file_location and reuses claude-cost.py's
table/tsv/md renderers and claude-cost-scan.py's timestamp parsing and
price-table cost lookup, so those stay defined in exactly one place each
in this repo (see docs/cost.md). This script's own fold_turns() below is
a DELIBERATE, NAMED DEVIATION from a pure function-level import:
claude-cost-scan.py's own scan_file() folds turns straight into
cost-only aggregates and never exposes a turn's message content, but
this script needs that content (to find Agent/Bash tool_use blocks and
text blocks) — so fold_turns() re-implements the same dedup algorithm
(message.id/requestId, line-fallback if neither is present, keep the
line with the highest output_tokens) while also carrying the surviving
line's full, UNIONED content-block list (a turn with two tool_use blocks
issued in one message puts each block on its own JSONL line, both
sharing message.id — taking only the max-output_tokens line's content
would silently drop whichever block was not on that one line).

Events file format (the deliverable): one JSON object per line, keys in
this fixed order: ts, script, scripts, event, cause, outcome, round,
session, agent_id, agent_type, model, turns, tokens, usd, duration_s,
findings, ticket, source, key, note. `event` is one of: author | review |
lint | selftest | rework | live-run | accepted | invoke | owner_wait
(live-run and accepted are manual-only, via `record`).

`invoke` events: one per Bash tool_use block, across EVERY transcript
scanned — the main-thread session transcript itself, and every subagent
transcript regardless of agentType, not only script-author/
script-reviewer — whose command actually RUNS at least one scripts/*.sh,
scripts/*.py, hooks/*.sh, or hooks/*.py path in an executable position of
one of its shell segments (see find_script_invocations()), excluding a
lint-shaped command entirely (its arguments are files being linted, not
run). This is a usage signal, not an authoring signal: it answers "is this
script actually being run", the quantitative check behind the "does a
one-off become a reusable script" bar.

No new EVENT_KEYS field was added for `invoke` — three existing fields are
reused:
  - `cause` carries "selftest" when the invoked path itself is a
    *-selftest.sh/*-selftest.py script, else "-". `report --usage` uses
    this to exclude a selftest-shaped invocation from its thresholds.
  - `agent_type` carries the raw agentType string for a subagent-hosted
    call (the event is still recorded even for script-author/
    script-reviewer, but `report --usage` excludes those from its "real
    usage" counts, since a script's own author calling the very script it
    is writing is not a real-world use), or the literal string "main" for
    a Bash call found directly in the top-level session transcript.
  - `ticket` is always "-" on an invoke event — out of scope for what
    invoke detection tracks.

`--help`/`-h` invocations are counted as an ordinary `invoke` event, no
special-casing — telling "just checking usage" apart from "a real
invocation" from command text alone is unreliable and out of scope.

`owner_wait` events: one per owner-attended interval found in ANY
transcript scanned — main session or subagent, any agentType — so that
wall-clock time genuinely spent waiting on the owner has real interval
data instead of a guess. A wait STARTS at whichever of these is seen
first, in turn order, per OWNER_WAIT_TRIGGER_PREFIXES below (a list
constant so a project with a different interactive tool can extend the
trigger set without touching the detection logic itself):
  - a tool_use block whose name matches one of the configured trigger
    prefixes (default: an exact "AskUserQuestion", or any tool whose name
    starts with a configured MCP-server prefix) — the owner is being
    asked something and the agent blocks for the answer.
  - BEST-EFFORT, UNVERIFIED: the transcript's LAST text-shaped assistant
    turn, if its text matches HUMAN_STEP_RE (vocabulary for a genuinely
    human remainder: sign in, install an app, click in a console, act at
    a registrar, etc). No agent-state transition to blocked/idle is
    exposed in these transcripts at all, so this is a textual proxy, not
    a confirmed state transition — a directional lower bound only, never
    a precise measurement. It is the only one of the signals above that
    can both over-match (unrelated prose reusing the same words) and
    under-match (a human step phrased differently), which is why it gets
    its own `note` value below rather than folding into a trigger-prefix
    note.

A wait ENDS at the next "type":"user" line in the SAME transcript file
after the start. A start with no following "type":"user" line (still open
— unanswered as of extraction time) produces NO event; it is picked up on
a later extract run once it has an end.

No new EVENT_KEYS field was added for `owner_wait` either — four existing
fields are reused:
  - `session`/`agent_id`/`agent_type` carry the same values they would for
    any other event from that transcript ("main" for the top-level
    session, same as `invoke`).
  - `ticket` is the ticket already known for an attributed author/review
    subagent transcript, or, when that is unavailable, a best-effort scan
    of the transcript's OWN text for a ticket-shaped mention
    (extract_session_ticket()) — "-" if neither finds one.
  - `duration_s` carries the interval's seconds.
  - `note` carries which signal fired — one of the configured trigger
    notes, or "human_step_heuristic" — so a consumer can exclude the
    unverified signal from anything that needs to be precise.
`script`/`scripts` are always "-"/[] (an owner_wait is not about a
script), `cause`/`outcome`/`round` are always "-", and
`model`/`turns`/`tokens`/`usd` are always "-"/0/0/0.0.

`report --usage`: a quantitative check on whether a script is actually
being run, kept as a separate code path from the default `report` table
(the default output is untouched line-for-line by this feature). Per
script: invocations/sessions/pass-fail/first-last-used/lint+selftest run
counts/rework_rounds/lint_wall_clock_s/author_usd/rework_ratio, plus a
retirement `flag` — see usage_flag() for the exact keep/retire?/flag
precedence and its day/count thresholds. Only NON-TEST invocations count
toward any of this: an invoke event with cause "selftest", agent_type
script-author/script-reviewer, or a session matching one of the script's
own `author` events (the authoring session) is excluded — see
build_usage_rows(). A *-selftest.sh/*-selftest.py file never gets its own
row at all (USAGE_SELFTEST_FILE_RE) — it is a fixture, not a script anyone
else runs. `report --usage` also prints an owner_wait summary — total
owner-attended seconds per ticket in the same --since/--until window, plus
a wave-total row (see build_owner_wait_rows()).

Every already-recorded `script`/`scripts` value is resolved to its CURRENT
repo-relative path by basename lookup against the real scripts/ and
hooks/ trees on disk (normalize_script_path()) — both going forward, at
extract/record time, and via the `backfill-script-paths` subcommand for
events already on disk (rerunnable, not a one-time migration — a script
moving directories again needs this again). Without this, the same script
landed on two different rows depending on whatever path string a dispatch
prompt, Bash command, or `record --script` argument happened to use at the
time (a bare basename, or a stale subdirectory from before a move), each
carrying only a fraction of its real invocation count.

`rework` events: a script-author subagent RESUMED via SendMessage for
another round of work appends to its OWN transcript rather than spawning
a new subagent, so a fresh-invocation round (a brand-new author subagent
for the same script) is not the only way rework happens — resuming the
same one is at least as common. Each resume prompt inside an author
transcript (a "type":"user" line whose content is text-shaped, after the
first — see find_resume_prompts()) emits its own `rework` event, with
`round` continuing the same (session, script) counter the author event
started, and `cause` inferred from that resume's own prompt text via the
same review/lint/usage heuristics used for a fresh-invocation round. The
transcript is SLICED at each resume prompt's timestamp: the author
event's turns/tokens/usd/duration_s cover only the window up to the
first resume, and each rework event covers its own window up to the next
resume or the end — so the slices sum to the same total a
whole-transcript figure would give with no resumes. `report`'s `rounds`
and `rework_review`/`rework_lint`/`rework_usage` counts include `rework`
events alongside `author` events, and its turns/tokens/usd totals sum
`author` + `review` + `rework`.

`extract --session ID` and `extract --agent-id ID` (mutually exclusive)
restrict the scan to one session or one subagent, found by glob
(<projects-dir>/*/<ID>.jsonl or <projects-dir>/*/*/subagents/agent-<ID>.jsonl)
rather than walking every session under --projects-dir — for a
SubagentStop hook invoking this after every subagent finishes (see
hooks/script-events-hook.sh). Both are scope restrictions only:
idempotence by "key" is unchanged, and if the matched subagent's
agentType is not in scope (not script-author/script-reviewer, or in
--agent-types), the run exits 0 and writes nothing, same as it would
during a full scan. `--quiet` prints nothing on stdout when 0 new events
are found; the summary line still prints when any are.

Exit codes: 0 success, 2 a validation failure (bad input, printed to
stderr), 1 an unexpected error.

# -------------------------------------------------------- status-durations
# Derives `status_duration` events straight from
# the Jira changelog, not from a Claude Code transcript — the one command
# in this file that talks to the tracker at all. Read-only: every call
# goes through `jira-api.sh raw GET` (GET/HEAD-only, redacts before
# printing). provider.sh (the tracker seam) has no changelog verb, so this
# calls jira-api.sh directly, the same way jira-backfill.sh does outside
# the seam's four verbs — see providers/tracker/jira/provider.sh.
#
# One event per status the ticket occupied: the ticket's FIRST status
# (before any changelog entry exists) is timed from its own `created`
# field (a second small `raw GET /issue/<TICKET>?fields=created` call) to
# the first changelog entry's timestamp, using that entry's own
# `fromString` as the status name — skipped, with a one-line stderr note,
# when `created` is unavailable, never guessed; every later status runs
# from its own changelog entry's timestamp to the next entry's timestamp,
# or to `--until` (default now) for the ticket's current status. No new
# EVENT_KEYS column: `note` carries the status name, `duration_s` the
# seconds occupied, `source` is `"jira_changelog"` (not `"transcript"` or
# `"manual"`), and `session`/`agent_id`/`agent_type`/`script`/`cause`/
# `model` are all `"-"` placeholders. `outcome` is ALSO reused, but not as
# a placeholder: it carries `"closed"` for a status whose end came from a
# real transition (immutable once written) or `"open"` for the ticket's
# still-current status (end = `--until`, inherently provisional). `key` is
# `status_duration:<ticket>:<status>:<entry_ts>`, idempotent the same way
# every other event's key is EXCEPT for an `"open"` row: re-running with a
# later `--until`, or after the ticket has since transitioned, REWRITES
# that row in place rather than skipping it as already-present (source
# review round 2, HIGH — plain idempotence was silently freezing an open
# status's duration at whatever `--until` was on first observation; see
# reconcile_status_duration_events()). This command does not paginate the
# changelog endpoint — a ticket with more history than one page is
# truncated to its most recent page, surfaced as a stderr warning, never
# silently guessed past.

# Jira REST timestamps use a colon-less numeric UTC offset, e.g.
# "2026-09-02T00:00:00.000+0000" — datetime.fromisoformat only accepts a
# colon-less offset since Python 3.11, and this repo's declared floor is
# 3.9 (source review round 2, HIGH). JIRA_TZ_OFFSET_RE finds a trailing
# 4-digit offset with no colon and inserts one before handing off to
# parse_iso, which already handles everything else (including a bare "Z").

    """Return (rows, window_rework_ratio) for `report --usage`.

    `full_events` MUST be the events file's FULL contents, unfiltered by
    --since/--until. The `flag` column and the landing date it depends on
    are always LIFETIME figures, computed from a script's entire history,
    regardless of `row_since`/`row_until` — this is the retirement-verdict
    use case, and it must never move just because a wave's window
    changed. Truncating the INPUT events by --since/--until would let
    changing --until silently change a script's own "lifetime" invocation
    count and its keep/retire verdict — e.g. narrowing --until past a
    script's `author` event would drop that event out of the window
    entirely, voiding BOTH the authoring-session exclusion (its session no
    longer excludes anything) and the landing date (falling back to None,
    silently printing flag "-" with no signal the window had caused it).

    Every OTHER displayed column (invocations, sessions, pass/fail,
    first/last-used, lint/selftest/rework counts, lint wall clock,
    author_usd, rework_ratio) IS windowed by `row_since`/`row_until` when
    either is given: only events whose own `ts`
    falls inside [row_since, row_until) feed those numbers, so a wave's
    `--usage` call reports this-wave activity, not the script's whole
    history. With no window given, every event qualifies and these
    columns keep lifetime behaviour (unwindowed output stays
    byte-identical to before this ticket).

    A script ROW is included if it has at least one event anywhere in
    [row_since, row_until) — same gate as before this ticket — even
    though the row's OTHER numbers (not `flag`) are now computed from
    that windowed event subset, not from the script's whole history.

    The "non-test invocations" definition (see module docstring) is
    applied HERE, not at extraction: an `invoke` event with cause
    "selftest", agent_type "script-author"/"script-reviewer", or a
    session matching one of the script's own `author` events (the
    authoring session) is excluded from every column below, so a
    script's own build/review/selftest traffic never inflates its usage
    number. The authoring-session exclusion SET itself is always derived
    from a script's LIFETIME `author` events, window or no window — a
    wave whose window happens to exclude the original `author` event must
    not stop excluding that session's own dogfood invocations."""
