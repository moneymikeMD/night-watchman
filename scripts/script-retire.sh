#
# Turn a "retire?" flag from
# `script-analytics.py report --usage` into an actual retirement.
#
# Default mode is DRY-RUN: read the usage table, find every script whose
# flag is exactly "retire?", and print the plan — script path, its
# selftest, its docs/scripts.md row (if any), and the "Retired" line that
# would be added — without touching the working tree. Nothing is deleted,
# no branch is created, until --yes is passed.
#
# Scope, deliberately: this script auto-handles the script file, its
# selftest, and its docs/scripts.md table row (if this project keeps one —
# night-watchman's own scripts.mdx reference page is GENERATED from
# scripts/*.sh headers by gen-reference-docs.sh, so deleting the script
# file is what removes it from that page; docs/scripts.md here is only a
# hand-kept "## Retired" changelog, not a source table). Prose references
# in agents/, skills/, CLAUDE.md, or other docs/ files are LISTED for
# manual follow-up, never auto-edited: a text match on a script name
# inside prose can land in an unrelated sentence, and this script has no
# way to tell "the reference to delete" from "an example that happens to
# share the name". librarian has Edit tools for that; this script does
# not attempt to replace it.
#
# Usage:
#   script-retire.sh --events FILE [--since ISO] [--until ISO] [--dry-run]
#   script-retire.sh --events FILE --yes --ticket NWM-nnn
#
# --dry-run (default): print the retirement plan for every "retire?" row,
#   exit 0 whether or not any candidates were found.
# --yes: actually retire every current "retire?" candidate. For each:
#   create branch retire-<slug> off the current branch, `git rm` the
#   script and its selftest, remove its docs/scripts.md row (if any),
#   append a line under docs/scripts.md's "## Retired" section, commit,
#   then hand off to land-branch.sh <branch> <ticket> to merge/lint/
#   complete/push. Requires --ticket. Refuses on a dirty working tree
#   (this only ever branches from a clean tree).
#
# A script whose report --usage flag is anything other than "retire?"
# (keep, flag, -) never appears as a candidate — this script only ever
# acts on what the oracle itself flagged, never on a name passed by hand.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = ran (dry-run always; --yes only if every candidate
# retired cleanly), 1 = bad usage or a candidate failed to retire.
