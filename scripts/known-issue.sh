usage_migrate() {
    cat <<EOF
Usage: known-issue.sh migrate [--force] [--accept-severity-defaults]

ONE-SHOT. Parses the current docs/known-issues.md (hand-written prose plus a
hand-maintained index table) and splits it into one file per entry under
docs/known-issues/, then regenerates docs/known-issues.md as the index.

Heading detection is fence-aware for both \`\`\` and ~~~ code blocks, and is
cross-checked against a second, independently-shaped implementation before
being trusted. Every entry is staged to a temp directory and verified
entirely from a FRESH re-read of both the source and the staged files —
never the in-memory data used to decide what to write — before anything
goes live. If any check fails, nothing is written and the real
docs/known-issues/ and docs/known-issues.md are untouched.

A heading with no severity anywhere — not in the heading itself, not in a
matched index row — is never guessed. "Missing from the index" cannot tell
a genuine entry the table simply forgot from something that is not really
an entry at all (both shapes exist in the real doc). migrate refuses,
printing every such heading with its line number, unless
--accept-severity-defaults is given, in which case they are set to LOW and
named in the output for follow-up with \`known-issue.sh severity\`.

Refuses to run if docs/known-issues/ already exists and is non-empty, unless
--force is given. --force only helps when docs/known-issues.md has been
restored to real hand-written content (its own successful run overwrites
that path with the generated index, so running it twice back to back with
nothing else changed fails earlier, with its own explanation, for a more
fundamental reason). When it does run, --force refuses unless every
existing entry is simultaneously unmodified since this tool last wrote it,
still produced by this run, and not a manifest entry whose file was deleted
out from under it — see the header comment for the full three-part check.
EOF
    exit 0
}

usage_reindex() {
    cat <<EOF
Usage: known-issue.sh reindex

Regenerates docs/known-issues.md from the frontmatter of every file under
docs/known-issues/. Idempotent: running it twice with no entry changes
produces a byte-identical file.
EOF
    exit 0
}

usage_lint() {
    cat <<EOF
Usage: known-issue.sh lint

Verifies every docs/known-issues/*.md file parses, carries the required
frontmatter (title, severity, status, slug), has a slug matching its own
filename and unique among all entries, and that docs/known-issues.md is
exactly what \`reindex\` would produce right now. Exits non-zero on any
failure — this is the guard that keeps the index from drifting again.
EOF
    exit 0

usage_add() {

Usage: known-issue.sh add --title TITLE --severity SEV [--note NOTE]
                           [--ticket PREFIX-nnn]... [--body TEXT]

Creates a new entry file under docs/known-issues/ and reindexes.

  --title TITLE      required
  --severity SEV     required; one of $SEVERITIES
  --note NOTE        optional one-line note shown in the index row
  --ticket PREFIX-nnn optional, repeatable
  --body TEXT        entry body. If omitted, the body is read from stdin.

Example:
  known-issue.sh add --title "Foo is broken" --severity MEDIUM \\
      --ticket PROJ-200 <<< "Foo has been broken since ..."
EOF
    exit 0

usage_resolve() {

Usage: known-issue.sh resolve <slug> [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--note NOTE]

Marks an existing entry resolved and reindexes.

  <slug>             required; the entry's filename under docs/known-issues/
                     without the .md suffix
  --date DATE        resolved date, YYYY-MM-DD (default: today)
  --note NOTE        replaces the entry's index-row note
EOF

Usage: known-issue.sh severity <slug> <SEVERITY>

Changes an existing entry's severity and reindexes.

                     without the .md suffix
